""" This will allow me to generate HTML forms by using Django (source:

from django import forms

""" After reading the Django documentation on how to create Django forms, I decided to create the forms using 
Django’s libraries and tools instead of manually writing HTML forms in layouts.html. So, to create the forms, I 
decided to create a new file called forms.py. There, I will import the needed libraries to create forms. Then, from 
views.py and layout.html, I will call the forms from forms.py. I will put the forms.py file in the “auctions” folder, 
so that it’s located in the same directory as the views.py file.
