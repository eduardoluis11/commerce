    In fact, for the time being, it doesn't make sense to use a form here, since I'm only displaying the listing's
    information, not giving the user the option to edit it.

    To display the information on the page, I won’t use forms (for the time being), and I won’t use Bootstrap cards.
    I will use the entirety of the size of the browser. I’ll probably user a hero though.
