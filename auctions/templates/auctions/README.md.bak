# Commerce Homework Assignment


Author of the code: Eduardo Salinas

## Special Instruction:

You won't be able to assign a category to any product on any listing if there are no categories in the database. 
Since I'm not providing the database (since the instructions tell me that the only files and folders allowed
when you see my code are the "auctions" and "commerce" folders and the manage.py file,) you will have to insert 
at least a category into the database to be able to assign a category to a listing.

You could also use the Django admin panel to add categories to the database, since I added a model for the categories
called "categories".
